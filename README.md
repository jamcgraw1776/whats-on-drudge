Attempt to track news links selected by drudge for posting over time.   

Simple programing project to pull the news articles selected on the drudgereport.  I  intend to initially pull the individual links to track headlines and sources.  Eventually I may add analysis tools to identify how often sources change, what are the most common sources over time , text analysis on headlines selected, and some type of graphing capability with the data.

Also, this is an experement in the use of github.
